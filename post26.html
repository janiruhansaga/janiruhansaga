            <div class="prompt-text" id="aiPrompt">
                Create A hyper-realistic face of the uploaded person (preserve exact real face and body identity, no alterations) High-fidelity, true-to-source facial replication. Maintain 100% of the original person's facial likeness and identity from the provided user image. The user's original photo is for identity reference ONLY. You MUST replace the original pose, clothing, and background with the new style described below. Apply the following style: Apply a slender and lean body build to the subject. The subject has dark brown hair, almost black, styled short and neatly combed back, slightly swept to the side on top, with shorter faded sides. The perceived skin tone is light to medium olive. This is a hyper-realistic, ultra-realistic 8K photograph of a human, indistinguishable from a real photo, captured with a DSLR camera using a 50mm lens at F1.8, creating a shallow depth of field with cinematic lens blur (bokeh) in the background. The subject is in sharp focus, with realistic skin texture, visible skin pores, and fine hair strands. The image has a real-tone color balance, natural skin tones, and perfect, realistic human anatomy. The photo is in portrait orientation with a 4:5 aspect ratio. The camera is at an eye-level angle, capturing a medium close-up shot, from the chest up, with the subject's hands visible on a laptop. The subject is sitting upright in a high-backed ergonomic gaming chair, forearms resting on a dark desk, with hands poised over a black laptop keyboard and touchpad. The head is slightly tilted down, and the gaze is directed straight at the camera. The scene is set indoors during nighttime or in a dark room, illuminated by artificial light sources. The primary lighting is diffused ambient glow from multiple digital screens and LED light strips in the background and foreground, creating a strong dual-color illumination effect. Cool cyan/blue light emanates from the left and front, casting a blueish hue on the left side of the subject's face, skin, and clothing. Warm magenta/red light emanates from the right and background, casting a pinkish hue on the right side of the subject's face, skin, and clothing. Shadows are soft, reflecting the colored ambient light. Highlights are diffused and vibrant with color. The overall color palette is dark with rich, super-saturated neon cyan and magenta accents, creating a high-contrast, futuristic color grade. The subject is wearing matte black over-ear gaming headphones; the ear cups and specific parts of the headband feature a bright, internally illuminated electric cyan glow. The subject wears a black full-zip hoodie made of a soft cotton-blend fleece material, draping loosely. The hoodie features a prominent, internally illuminated orange triangular logo on the right chest, with two lines of glowing orange sans-serif text directly below it, which must be accurately recreated. The left sleeve and the right sleeve each feature white, stylized graphic patches with abstract shapes and outlines, glowing faintly with a cyan tint from the ambient light. Underneath the hoodie, a grey crew-neck t-shirt is visible, featuring a large, stylized, dark grey or black graphic print depicting abstract, faded shapes. The background is dark and heavily blurred by bokeh, revealing several glowing elements: a vertical strip of bright magenta/red light on the far left, a large rectangular screen emitting strong magenta/red light behind the subject's left side, and multiple smaller rectangular screens or panels emitting strong cyan/blue light behind the subject's right side. A black laptop with a backlit keyboard (glowing with cyan and magenta) and a black computer mouse are visible on the desk in the foreground. The vibe is futuristic, high-tech, and atmospheric, evoking a gaming or cyber-aesthetic.

            Here is a short description about this image. I used Midjourney/Stable Diffusion to create this. The main
            focus was on the lighting and reflections on the wet road.
